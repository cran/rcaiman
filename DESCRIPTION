Description: Classify hemispherical 
    photographs of the plant canopy with algorithms specially developed for 
    such a task and well documented in 
    Díaz and Lencinas (2015) <doi:10.1109/lgrs.2015.2425931> and 
    Díaz and Lencinas (2018) <doi:10.1139/cjfr-2018-0006>. It supports 
    non-circular hemispherical photography, such as those acquired with  
    15 mm lenses or with auxiliary fish-eye lenses attached to mobile devices. 
    Most of the functions also support restricted view photography.
